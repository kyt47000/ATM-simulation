# ATM Simulation System

ðŸ“Ÿ **ATM Simulation System** is a Java-based application that simulates the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The system allows users to perform various transactions like withdrawals, deposits, balance checks, and more, through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project aims to provide a practical demonstration of object-oriented programming and Java Swing for GUI development.

## About the Project

The ATM Simulation System offers a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the system using a card number and PIN. It provides essential ATM operations, including:

- **Withdrawals**: Withdraw money from your account.
- **Deposits**: Deposit money into your account.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Check the balance of your account.
- **Account Statements**: Request statements for your transactions.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration process.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Java Swing, the system provides an interactive and intuitive user experience.
- **User Authentication**: Includes secure sign-in and sign-up processes.
- **Email Notifications**: Notifies users of successful transactions and account activities via email.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves user data and transaction history to files for easy management.

## Development Environment

### IntelliJ IDEA

The project was developed using **IntelliJ IDEA**, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) by JetBrains. IntelliJ IDEA offers powerful features such as:

- **Smart Code Completion**: Provides relevant code suggestions based on context.
- **Built-in Version Control**: Integrates with Git, GitHub, and other version control systems.
- **Robust Debugging Tools**: Helps with identifying and fixing errors efficiently.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

IntelliJ IDEA was chosen for its comprehensive support for Java development, intelligent code assistance, and seamless integration with external libraries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE
- The following external libraries must be included in the classpath:
  - `activation-1.1.jar`
  - `javax-mail-1.6.2.jar`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/atm-simulation-system.git
   cd atm-simulation-system
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **Add External Libraries**:
   - Download `activation-1.1.jar` and `javax-mail-1.6.2.jar`.
   - Add these libraries to your project's classpath.

4. **Run the Project**:
   Execute the `Main.java` file to start the ATM simulation.

## Modifying Email Service Credentials

The system includes an email notification feature that uses the JavaMail API. If you need to enable email notifications or use a different email service, you'll need to edit the credentials in `EmailService.java`:

1. Open `EmailService.java`.
2. Find the following lines:
   ```java
   this("your-email@example.com", "your-email-password");
   ```
3. Replace `"your-email@example.com"` with your email address and `"your-email-password"` with your email password or an app-specific password.

**Note:** For security reasons, avoid using your main email password. Instead, use an app-specific password if your email provider supports it.

## Built With

- **Java Swing**: For building the GUI.
- **JavaMail API**: For handling email notifications.
- **Java AWT**: For additional GUI components.
- **Java IO**: For handling input/output operations.
- **Java Util**: For utility classes like ArrayList and HashMap.
